# Test-Driven Development (TDD) Exercise: FizzBuzz
<hr>

## FizzBuzz TDD Exercise aimed at practicing Test-Driven Development (TDD) using JavaScript.

### Project Overview
In this exercise, I implemented the FizzBuzz algorithm using the TDD approach. The FizzBuzz algorithm is a common programming challenge where you print numbers from 1 to a given number (inclusive), but for multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for multiples of 5, print "Buzz". For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

### How to Run the Tests
To run the tests for the FizzBuzz function, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:
`git clone https://github.com/your-username/fizzbuzz-tdd.git`

Navigate to the project directory:

`cd fizzbuzz-tdd`
Install the required dependencies (assuming you're using Jest for testing):

`npm install`
Run the tests:
`npm test`
This command will execute the tests defined in the index.test.js file and display the test results in your terminal.

### Test Cases
The following test cases were implemented to verify the functionality of the FizzBuzz algorithm:

Test 1: Given a number, num, as input, it returns an array from 1 to the num.
Test 2: Given a number that is divisible by 3, it prints "Fizz".
Test 3: Given a number that is divisible by 5, it prints "Buzz".
Test 4: Given a number that is divisible by both 3 and 5, it prints "FizzBuzz".
Each test case validates a specific aspect of the FizzBuzz algorithm to ensure that it behaves correctly under different scenarios.
